# rime-emoji_s
Yet another emoji / 絵文字 input scheme for RIME, including scripts used in generating it.

The dictionaries are based on data from [gemoji](https://github.com/github/gemoji) and [Emojipedia](https://github.com/gingerbeardman/Emojipedia).

Requires python module xmltodict (if you want to build the files by yourself).
